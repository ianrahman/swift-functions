## Introduction

As a language, Swift blends the programming paradigms of [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) with many elements of [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). This approach is more synonymous with modern programming languages like Ruby and Python which blend the paradigms also. Since Swift is capable of Object-Oriented Programming structures and thought patterns, it's capable of interfacing with code written in Objective-C which is a language that provides no support for functional programming beyond its C heritage.

### Functions vs. Methods

In contrast to Objective-C, however, Swift permits implementations of functions that can be performed *without* an associated object (i.e. performed by the system itself). This is the philosophical distinction between methods and functions and the only distinguishing characteristic in Swift between writing methods and writing functions. The syntax is for either is identical with the exception that methods are associated with a particular class and have various options for visibility. We'll discuss methods in more detail in later lessons.

All functions are available globally, meaning that they can be called from anywhere in a project which contains them. However, functions are written in a procedural manner which means that in their containing file, they can only be called *after* their definitions.

Take for example the `print()` function that we've already introduced and had you use. It's a function (which means that it is performed by the system) with the defined behavior of sending an interpolated string parameter to the Console Output viewer (a.k.a. the Debug Console). It's defined once in the Swift Foundation library and available anywhere that the Swift Foundation is imported (which will generally be *everywhere* in a Swift project).

```swift
print("Heyyy, iOS!")
```
This will print: `Heyyy, iOS!`.

## Creating a Custom Function

Function declarations follow this full syntax form:

```swift
func nameOfFunctionParameter1(parameter1: Type1, parameter2: Type2) -> ReturnType {
    // implementation
}
```
We're going to work up to this, starting with a simple function that takes no parameters and provides no return.

### Simple Functions

Let's write a function that we can reuse anywhere to remind ourselves to walk around every once in a while. We're just going to have it define the simple behavior or printing a string that reads "Take a walk!".

We'll need to start with the keyword `func` that tells the compiler we'll be defining a new function starting on this line.

```swift
func
```
Then we'll need to give our function a name, ending with an empty parenthesis which signifies that our function takes no parameters (or arguments), and opens the curly braces which defines the body of the function's implementation:

```swift
func printTakeAWalk() {

}
```
**Top-tip:** *When writing a function which takes no parameters, do not forget the trailing parenthesis. Is is a required part of Swift's function syntax and cannot be omitted.*

Now we're going to define the behavior that we want the function to perform, which is to print "Take a walk!":

```swift
func printTakeAWalk() {
    print("Take a walk!")
}
```
Great! Now we can remind ourselves to stay active.

##### Calling A Simple Function

To call our custom function which takes no parameters, we simply type the name of the function on a new line:

```swift
func printTakeAWalk() {
    print("Take a walk!")
}
printTakeAWalk()
```
This will print `Take a walk!` just like we told it to.

We can call it a second time to reuse our code:

```swift
func printTakeAWalk() {
    print("Take a walk!")
}
printTakeAWalk()
printTakeAWalk()
```
However, we *cannot* call our function *before* its definition in the file that contains it:

```swift
printTakeAWalk()  // error
func printTakeAWalk() {
    print("Take a walk!")
}
printTakeAWalk()
printTakeAWalk()
```
This produces an error that reads `Use of unresolved identifier 'printTakeAWalk'`:

### Functions With A Return Type

Functions which don't provide a return are actually pretty rare (though *methods* which don't return anything are common), so let's write a function that returns something. Let's standardize a greeting for the iOS class that goes "Heyyy, iOS!". Our function should simple a return a string containing this value.

Let's start our new custom function just like we did before, using a different name:

```swift
func heyIOS()
```

But this time let's define it with a return type of `String`. After the closing parenthesis which encapsulates the (absent, in this case) parameters, we insert a right arrow `->` and the name of the type (`String` in this case), followed by the opening curly brace:

```swift
func heyIOS() -> String {

}
```
Now that we have our function opened, we can use the `return` keyword to pass back a string with our greeting in it:

```swift
func heyIOS() -> String {
    return "Heyyy, iOS!"
}
```
Great! Now we can access our standard greeting from anywhere in our code.

#### Capturing A Function's Return

We can capture our function's return into an instance by using `let` or `var` and the assignment operator `=`:

```swift
let greeting = heyIOS()
```
The instance `greeting` will now hold the string value `Heyyy, iOS!`, and be implicitly typed to match the method's return type.

We can then print this instance as normal:

```swift
print(greeting)
```
Or we can nest the function call by passing it directly into a another function's parameters, such as in printing the return of `heyIOS()` directly:

```swift
print(heyIOS())
```
Both of these will print: `Heyyy, iOS!`.

##### Namespace Errors

It's important to note that attempting to use a function's name to name an instance will produce an error. If we attempt to capture the return of `heyIOS()` into an instance named `heyIOS`, the compiler will complain:

```swift
func heyIOS() -> String {
    return "Heyyy, iOS!"
}
let heyIOS = heyIOS()  // error
``` 
![](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/swift/swift-functions/error_variable_used_within_its_own_initial_value.png)

So instead we have to name our capturing instance something else such as `greeting` like we did above.

### Functions With One Parameter (a.k.a Argument)

To write a custom function which takes a single a parameter, we're going to follow the syntax:

```swift
func nameOfFunctionParameter1(parameter1: Type1) -> ReturnType {
    // implementation
}
```
Notice the repetition of the first parameter's name in both the function's name *and* inside the parenthesis? The parameter's name inside the parenthesis defines its instance name within the scope of the function's body, so it's necessary for the logic of defining the function. The parameter name in the method call is style convention since the first parameter's name inside the parenthesis is not part of Swift function-calling syntax, so it is convention to name the parameter in the function itself. Experienced Objective-C developers will find this practice familiar.

Let's write a dynamic version of our `heyIOS()` function that takes a parameter for who we're going to greet with it. Let's call our new function `heyGroup()` and name its string parameter `group`:

```swift
func heyGroup(group: String) -> String {

}
```
Since it returns a string, let's interpolate the parameter string into the return instance:

```swift
func heyGroup(group: String) -> String {
    return "Heyyy, \(group)!"
}
```
#### Calling A Single-Parameter Function

Now we can use generate our special salutation for any group that we wish to greet. We need to pass it a string parameter, so let's start with our "iOS" group to make sure it works right:

```swift
let greetIOS = heyGroup("iOS")
```
The `greetIOS` instance will hold the value `"Heyyy, iOS!"`.

We could also pass the function's return directly to the `print()` function:

```swift
print(heyGroup("iOS"))
```
This will print: `Heyyy, iOS!`.

Perfect! If we pass it a different string parameter its return should adapt accordingly:

```swift
let greetWeb = heyGroup("Web")
let greetEveryone = heyGroup("everyone")
```
The `greetWeb` instance will hold the value `"Heyyy, Web!"`.  
The `greetEveryone` instance will hold `"Heyyy, everyone!"`.

##### Argument Type Error

But what happens if we try passing our function a parameter that doesn't match the expected type?

```swift
let greetValjean = heyGroup(24601)  // error
```
We get an error reading `Cannot convert value of type 'Int' to expected argument type 'String'`. Oops!

![](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/swift/swift-functions/error_cannot_convert_value_to_expected_argument_type.png)

However, if we convert the parameter to the correct type, the compiler will accept it:

```swift
let greetValjean = heyGroup("24601")  // accepted
```

### Functions With Two Parameters

Now we're ready to unpack the full syntax from the beginning of this lesson:

```swift
func nameOfFunctionParameter1(parameter1: Type1, parameter2: Type2) -> ReturnType {
    // implementation
}
```

Inside the parenthesis, additional parameter are listed by `name: Type` separated by commas. Only the first parameter name may be included in the function's name since the names of all additional parameters are part of the function-calling syntax:

```swift
let capture = nameOfFunctionParameter1(<value>, parameter2: <value>)
```

Let's create a new function that takes two parameters, one for the group, and for a speaker who's come to talk to the students, and return a string containing a message to tell the students:

```swift
func heyListenGroup(group: String, speaker: String) -> String {
    return "Heyyy, \(group)! Come listen to \(speaker) give a talk."
}
```
The base name of our new function is `heyListen` to which we've added the name of the first parameter which is `group`. There is a second string parameter for `speaker` listed inside the parenthesis and used in string interpolation that is returned.

To call our function, doing so would look like this:

```swift
let listenToJoe = heyListenGroup("iOS", speaker: "Joe")
```
The instance `listenToJoe` will now hold the value `"Heyyy, iOS! Come listen to Joe give a talk."`.

Notice how the second parameter is named in the function call?

### Functions With Many Parameters

Functions which take more than two parameters follow this same syntax. To show an example, let's write a new function that also tells the students how long in minutes the speaker will talk. We'll need to define our function with a third parameter `minutes` that takes an integer:

```swift
func heyListenGroup(group: String, speaker: String, minutes: Int) -> String {
    return "Heyyy, \(group)!" Come listen to \(speaker) give a talk for \(minutes) minutes."
}
```
We can then call our function in a similar way, passing in a value of the correct type for each parameter:

```swift
let listenToOrta = heyListenGroup("everyone", speaker: "Orta", minutes: 60)
```
The instance `listenToOrta` will hold the value `"Heyyy, everyone!" Come listen to Orta give a talk for 60 minutes."`.

Did you notice that we wrote a completely separate function with the same base name `heyListenGroup` and yet the compiler never complained? The compiler differentiates it by the parameters it takes. Objective-C developers will find this familiar because the names of the parameters are seen as part of the function's name.
